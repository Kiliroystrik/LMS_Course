# Evaluation
## Practical Case: Implementation of a Learning Management System (LMS)

### Client Requirements:

The client aims to develop a website/application to manage all educational resources. Students and instructors can register and log in using their credentials (email, password).

Each student belongs to a single session, whereas instructors can teach multiple sessions. Each session comprises various courses with distinct names (e.g., Symfony) and dates (e.g., from 01/01 to 05/01) to create a timetable for student reference. Sessions must have unique names for easy retrieval. The platform allows students to access all course content. Additionally, for each session, a list of enrolled students and a "trombinoscope" (photos of all session students) can be displayed.

Instructors can create evaluations directly on the platform, including various types (multiple choice, practical work, etc.). Instructors are also able to assign grades to students for these evaluations.

### Tasks to Accomplish
- Create an Entity-Relationship Diagram (MCD) representing all project data.
- Provide a Logical Data Model (MLD) in text format listing all tables and their relationships.
- Develop an SQL script to set up this database.
